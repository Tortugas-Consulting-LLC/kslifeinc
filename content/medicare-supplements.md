                    <p class="mb-4">The high cost-sharing (deductibles and co-pays) of Medicare makes paying out of pocket an unreasonable option for most people. A Medicare Supplement (or Medicare Supplemental Insurance or Medigap Policy) is an insurance plan sold by a private insurance company to cover the gaps in Medicare.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">Medicare Supplements are currently available in several different standardized plans. These plans are labeled A – N and cover different amounts of your cost sharing with Medicare. The premium for your Medicare Supplement will be in addition to the premium for Part B of Medicare.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">All Medicare Supplements identified by the same letter have the same coverage regardless of the company you choose. Cost IS the only difference between Medicare Supplement Insurance sold by different companies.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">The chart below shows the benefits included in each plan. Every company must sell Plan A, which is the basic plan, or the “core benefit” plan. Remember, the plans are standardized. So, Plan F from one company will be the same as Plan F from another company. Select the supplement policy which fits your needs, and then purchase that plan from an industry leader with the lowest premiums and favorable A.M. Best rating.</p>
                    <h5>Core Benefits:</h5>
                    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                        <li>Included in all plans.</li>
                        <li>Pays Part A Hospital copayment ($341 per day for 61-90 days and $682 per day for 91-150 days)</li>
                        <li>Pays for an additional 365 days of hospitalization after Medicare benefits end.</li>
                        <li>Pays Part B copayment (usually 20% of the Medicare-approved amount)</li>
                        <li>Pays for the first three pints of blood per year.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="part-b tab-content hidden">
                    <p class="mb-4">How to read the chart:</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">If a checkmark appears in a column of this chart, the Medigap policy covers 100% of the described benefit. If a column lists a percentage, the policy covers that percentage of the described benefit. If a column is a blank, the policy doesn’t cover that benefit. </p>
                    <p class="mb-4"><strong>Note:</strong> The Medigap policy covers coinsurance only after you have paid the deductible (unless the Medigap policy also covers the deductible).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="part-c tab-content hidden">
                    <p class="mb-4">Medicare Advantage Plan = Privatized Medicare – this is Part C, it includes Part A and Part B. A private Insurance company takes over your Medicare coverage and is paid to manage it. Medicare Advantage Plans include Medicare Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO), Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO), Private- Fee-for- Service (PFFS) and Medicare Special Needs plans.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">When you sign up with a Medicare Advantage Plan, you use the health insurance card that you get from the plan for your health care. In most of these plans, generally there are extra benefits and lower copayments than in the Original Medicare Plan. However, you typically have to see doctors that belong to the plan or go to certain hospitals to get services.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">To join a Medicare Advantage Plan, you must have Medicare Part A and Part B. You will have to pay your monthly Medicare Part B premium to Medicare. In addition, you might have to pay a monthly premium to your Medicare Advantage Plan for the extra benefits that they offer. Unlike Medicare Supplements, not all Medicare Advantage Plans work the same way, so find out the rules before you sign up.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">If you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, a Medigap policy/Medicare Supplement Insurance won’t work. This means it won’t pay any deductibles, copayments, or other cost-sharing under your Medicare Advantage Plan. Therefore, if you have a Medicare Supplement you will want to drop it if you join a Medicare Advantage Plan.</p>
                    <p class="mb-4">In addition, it is important to remember a major difference between Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare Supplements: Once you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan you can only disenroll during certain times of the year. With a Medicare Supplement, you are free to enroll or disenroll at any time of the year.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="part-d tab-content hidden">
                    <p class="mb-4">You must choose between a large number of plans and varying drug coverage and cost-sharing amounts. Some plans are better than others depending on the prescription drugs that you are taking. You can sign up with a drug plan when you first receive your Medicare Card or during Part D Open Enrollment for the following year from October 15 – December 7th. It is advisable to compare plans during open enrollment of each year that your prescription needs change.
